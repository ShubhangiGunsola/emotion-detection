# emotion-detection
Hereâ€™s a step-by-step implementation of a Facial Emotion Detection model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in Python. This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of Python, machine learning, and CNN concepts.


---

Step 1: Import Required Libraries

---

Step 2: Load and Preprocess Data

---

Step 3: Data Augmentation (Optional)

Augmentation increases the diversity of the training dataset.

---

Step 4: Build the CNN Model

Construct the CNN architecture.

---

Step 5: Train the Model

Use the training and validation sets to train the model.

---

Step 6: Evaluate the Model


---

Step 7: Save and Load the Model

Save the model for later use.

---

Step 8: Test the Model with New Data

Test the model with individual images (e.g., webcam or static images).

Conclusion

This step-by-step guide walks through preprocessing, data augmentation, model building, training, evaluation, and prediction. Fine-tune the hyperparameters or add more layers if necessary to improve performance.
